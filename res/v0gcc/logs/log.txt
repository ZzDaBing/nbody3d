In run , 3 loops were discarded from static analysis because their coverage
are lower than object_coverage_threshold value (0.01%).
That represents 0% of the execution time. To include them, change the value
in the experiment directory configuration file, then rerun the command with the additionnal parameter
--force-static-analysis
